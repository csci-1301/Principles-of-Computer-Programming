## Question:

Analyze how variables change state in this code:

```csharp
<<CODE_SNIPPET>>
```

**Tasks:**

1. Create a table that tracks the state of each variable after each line of code, noting dependencies and when values are read versus modified.
2. Analyze how variables affect each other, identifying patterns and dependencies in their state changes.
3. Evaluate the code's design, suggesting potential simplifications or improvements and identifying any potential issues.
