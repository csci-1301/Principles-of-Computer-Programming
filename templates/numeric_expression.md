## Question:

Evaluate the following expression:

```csharp
<<EXPRESSION>>
```

**Given:**

*   Data types: <<DATA_TYPES>>
*   Initial values: <<INITIAL_VALUES>>

**Tasks:**

1. Create an evaluation plan and execute it, showing each step, explaining the order of operations, tracking type conversions, and noting potential precision issues.
2. Explain the final result, including its value and type. Discuss whether this expression could produce different results in other languages and what assumptions were made about precision or rounding. Explain how changing data types would affect the result.
3. <<EXTRA_TASK>>
