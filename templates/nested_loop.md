## Question:

Analyze this nested loop:

```csharp
<<NESTED_LOOP_CODE>>
```

**Tasks:**

1. Trace the execution of both loops, showing the iteration pattern.
2. Explain how the inner and outer loops affect each other and what drives each loop's iterations.
3. Calculate the total number of iterations and suggest potential improvements for efficiency.
