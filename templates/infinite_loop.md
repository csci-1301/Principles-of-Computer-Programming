## Question:

Analyze these loops:

```csharp
// Loop 1
<<LOOP_1>>

// Loop 2
<<LOOP_2>>

// Loop 3
<<LOOP_3>>
```

**Tasks:**

1. Identify which loops are infinite and explain why they don't terminate.
2. Identify the conditions or variables that prevent termination.
3. Modify the infinite loops to ensure they terminate correctly.
