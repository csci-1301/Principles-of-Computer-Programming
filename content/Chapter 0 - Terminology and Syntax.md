Welcome to level -1, a place where we explore ideas and concepts that exist in a vacuum and can't be sensibly built up to like the rest of our content. I don't expect any reader to "understand" anything from this section super in depth, just try to remember it and trust me that it's important.

## How to talk about code

This may come as a surprise to you, but we will spend most of this book talking about code and computer programs on almost every page of this book. Therefore I think it only fair that I share some core terms and ideas that we will be using throughout.

- bodies of code
	- lines [[Chapter 1 - Values and Types]]
	- blocks

## C# Syntax

(NOTE: use https://learnxinyminutes.com/csharp/ to find all intricacies about the syntax to explain here)
